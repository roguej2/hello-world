hello-world
===========

My name is Raymond and I hope to someday be a programmer. I have been taking courses in school and will be receiving my associate's degree pretty soon but I know that limited amount of experience will do nothing for me. I will now fill this repository with projects I work on in my free time in order to build my experience.
